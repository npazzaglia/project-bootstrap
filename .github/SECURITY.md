# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not create a GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately by emailing [nick@pazztech.com].

We will review your report within 3 business days and take appropriate action as soon as possible.

## Supported Versions

This template does not maintain versioned releases. Security fixes will be applied to `main` and should be merged downstream by forks or users.

## Responsible Disclosure

We support and value responsible disclosure practices. Please provide as much detail as possible in your report so we can quickly validate and address the issue.
