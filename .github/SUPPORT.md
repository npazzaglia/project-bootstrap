# Support

This project is maintained by @npazzaglia.

For questions, bugs, or feature requests:

- Please [open an issue](../../issues) using the appropriate template
- For security concerns, refer to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- For general discussions, use GitHub Discussions (if enabled) or email

If you're using a fork of this template, support is not guaranteedâ€”maintainers of downstream projects should handle their own triage.
